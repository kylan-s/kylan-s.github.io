    I am a Mathematics PhD student at North Carolina State University. My research interests include fusion
    category theory and group cohomology. I am also to some extent interested in <a
        href="https://kaschatz.wordpress.ncsu.edu/visualizations/">computer algebra</a> and combinatorics.
    My advisor is <a href="https://www.coreyjonesmath.com/">Dr. Corey Jones</a>.
